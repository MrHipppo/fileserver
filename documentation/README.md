# fileserver

This is a little project of an Fileserver I am working on, because I am bored, and I wanted to improve my skills for university.
If you want to use it, just clone the repository, and have fun.

You need a few commands before you can start the fileserver:

at first we need apache2:

	sudo apt-get install apache2
you need php7.0:

	sudo apt-egt install php7.0
install also mysql-server:

	sudo apt-get install mysql-server
in the installation, you have to set the root password
install the libapache2-mod-php7.0

	sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-php7.0

after that you might need to change the /etc/php/7.0/apache2/php.ini to allow uploads
if you are working on a ubuntu server, change the owner of the lofiles and uploadfolder to www-data, otherwise to apache
	sudo chown www-data masteruploads/
	
mysql:
